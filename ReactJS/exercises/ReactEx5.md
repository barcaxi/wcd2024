# React.js Exercise 5 â€“ ``List`` Component Event Handling

There are 2 ways (options) of implementing an event handler for a component:

1.	Define the handler inside the component
2.	Define the handler outside the component and pass as a function prop

Part 1 and 2 below will implement both of these solutions.

## Part 1 - ``List`` Component with Event Handler Inside

Watch the video *10. Event Handling options for Components*

1.	Modify the ``List`` component to provide an in component event handler.  (Option 1)


## Part 2 - ``List`` Component with Event Handler Outside 

Watch the video *10. Event Handling options for Components*

1.	Modify/change the ``List`` component to receive the event handler as a function prop (Option 2)


## Part 3 - ``MyButton`` Revisited

Revisit ``MyButton`` implemented in [React Exercise 2](./ReactEx2.md) and make the button reusable by:

- passing the button caption as a prop
- passing the event handler as a function prop
